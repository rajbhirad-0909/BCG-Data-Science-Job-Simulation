Background Information​Welcome—we’re excited you’re here.​BCG X is the tech build and design unit of BCG where our teams combine cutting-edge technology, data science, and human-centered design to build and scale the bold ideas that deliver real impact for our clients. Today, you’ll be stepping into the shoes of a BCG X Data Scientist to gain first-hand experience solving complex problems at the intersection of business, data, and technology.​In this simulation, you’ll be working with a case team to help a client, PowerCo, investigate a problem with customer churn. PowerCo suspects price sensitivity is driving their customers to switch providers—the data tells a more complex story. Your job is to dig into the data, develop hypotheses, build predictive models, and translate your insights into strategic recommendations. This experience reflects the real work our teams do every day: •Framing business problems through a data science lens •Analyzing and cleaning real-world datasets •Engineering features that drive better predictions •Building and evaluating models using tools like Python •Communicating your findings in a clear, actionable way But this simulation isn’t just about the technical steps—it’s about embracing curiosity, independence, and iteration. Like many BCG X projects, you’ll work with incomplete information, balance multiple hypotheses, and encounter unfamiliar terminology. Our teams thrive on ambiguity and move fast to uncover what matters most. Whether you’re passionate about analytics, interested in how AI drives decisions, or just love solving tough problems with a creative, data-driven mindset—you’re in the right place. Task 2: Understand the business and frame the problem Before we begin Here are some key facts about this program: You are working as a Junior Data Scientist at BCG X You work within a larger team, where each member has a different role and level of responsibility. Your team has been assigned a new project for a client called PowerCo As a Junior Data Scientist, this is an opportunity to get valuable hands-on experience. You’ll work on your programming, problem solving and communication skills - all essential skills for life on the job as a data scientist! Important note: You’ll need to have an understanding of Python before starting this program. If you do not know Python, you are welcome to give it a try, but it might be a little challenging for you! First, let’s find out more on being a Data Scientist at BCG X.What is a Data Scientist? What exactly is a Data Scientist? A Data Scientist works with data to try and deliver value to a business. But how is that achieved? Data Science can sometimes overlap with domains such as Data Analysts, Data Engineers and DevOps. How much the Data Scientists role overlaps with these other roles really depends on the company, but in essence a Data Scientist is generally focused on modeling data to be able to accurately predict an outcome, for example, predicting how likely customers are to leave. 4 core skills are used as a Data Scientist: statistics, mathematics, programming and communication. Now let’s find out what Data Science looks like at BCG X.​
